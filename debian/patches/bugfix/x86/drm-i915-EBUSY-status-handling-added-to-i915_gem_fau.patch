Subject: drm/i915: EBUSY status handling added to i915_gem_fault().

commit e79e0fe380847493266fba557217e2773c61bd1b upstream.

Subsequent threads returning EBUSY from vm_insert_pfn() was not handled
correctly. As a result concurrent access from new threads to
mmapped data caused SIGBUS.

Note that this fixes i-g-t/tests/gem_threaded_tiled_access.
