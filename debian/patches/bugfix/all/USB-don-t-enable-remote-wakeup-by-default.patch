Subject: [PATCH 2/2] USB: don't enable remote wakeup by default

commit 7aba8d014341341590ecb64050b7a026642a62eb upstream.

This patch (as1364) avoids enabling remote wakeup by default on all
non-root-hub USB devices.  Individual drivers or userspace will have
to enable it wherever it is needed, such as for keyboards or network
interfaces.  Note: This affects only system sleep, not autosuspend.

External hubs will continue to relay wakeup requests received from
downstream through their upstream port, even when remote wakeup is not
enabled for the hub itself.  Disabling remote wakeup on a hub merely
prevents it from generating wakeup requests in response to connect,
disconnect, and overcurrent events.
