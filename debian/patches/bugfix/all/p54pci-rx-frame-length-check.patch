Subject: [PATCH] p54pci: rx frame length check

commit f5300e04df78feae8107c1846dd3a9e27c071b2f upstream.

A long time ago, a user reported several crashes due to
data corruptions which are likely the result of a
not-100%-supported, or faulty? PCI bridge.
( http://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/53004/ )

This patch fixes entry #1.
"1.  p54p_check_rx_ring - skb_over_panic: Under a ping flood
or just left running for a bit would panic with a skb_over_panic."
As described in the mail: The invalid frame length causes
skb_put to bailout and trigger a crash.

Note:
Simply dropping the frame is problematic, because if its content
contains a tx feedback we would lose some portion of the device
memory space.... And the driver/mac80211 should handle all other
invalid data.
