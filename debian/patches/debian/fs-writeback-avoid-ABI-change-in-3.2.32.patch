Subject: fs-writeback: Avoid ABI changes in 3.2.32

For some reason, adding an EXPORT_SYMBOL in the middle of fs-writeback.c
changes versions for the later exports.  I can't think why this is, and
I'm sure this normally doesn't cause any problems, but I'm not going to
spend time investigating further.
