Subject: ALSA: avoid ABI change in 3.2.34
Date: Sun, 18 Nov 2012 03:10:21 +0000

Commit 3b4a36722e5e518e4bdd3a215d8a1c5adc18e911 ('ALSA: Add a
reference counter to card instance', commit
a0830dbd4e42b38aefdf3fb61ba5019a1a99ea85 upstream) added a
reference count to struct snd_card.

This structure must be allocated by snd_card_create(), not by drivers.
It allocates space after the structure for driver-specific data, but
drivers should access this via the private_data pointer initialised by
snd_card_create(), not using sizeof(struct snd_card).  Therefore we
can move the new member to the end of the structure and hide it from
genksyms, and there is no ABI change.
