Subject: audit: Increase maximum number of names logged per syscall to 30
Date: Sat, 15 Dec 2012 01:03:52 +0000
Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/631799

Increase maximum number of names logged per syscall to 30, as the
current value of 20 can be too small.  This was enough for Rik Theys
who reported #631799.

There is a better but bigger fix upstream, commit 5195d8e217a7
('audit: dynamically allocate audit_names when not enough space is in
the names array').
