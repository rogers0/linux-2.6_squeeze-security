Subject: [09/12] [SCSI] scsi: virtio-scsi: Fix address translation failure of
 HighMem pages used by sg list

commit 27e99ade81368e6fdda3212bff9345177cf9e57a upstream.

When using the commands below to write some data to a virtio-scsi LUN of the
QEMU guest(32-bit) with 1G physical memory(qemu -m 1024), the qemu will crash.

        # sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb  (/dev/sdb is the virtio-scsi LUN.)
        # sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt
        # dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/file bs=1M count=1024

In current implementation, sg_set_buf is called to add buffers to sg list which
is put into the virtqueue eventually. But if there are some HighMem pages in
table->sgl you can not get virtual address by sg_virt. So, sg_virt(sg_elem) may
return NULL value. This will cause QEMU exit when virtqueue_map_sg is called
in QEMU because an invalid GPA is passed by virtqueue.

Two solutions are discussed here:
http://lkml.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1207.3/00675.html

Finally, value assignment approach was adopted because:

Value assignment creates a well-formed scatterlist, because the termination
marker in source sg_list has been set in blk_rq_map_sg(). The last entry of the
source sg_list is just copied to the the last entry in destination list.  Note
that, for now, virtio_ring does not care about the form of the scatterlist and
simply processes the first out_num + in_num consecutive elements of the sg[]
array.

I have tested the patch on my workstation. QEMU would not crash any more.
