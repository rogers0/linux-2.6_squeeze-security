Subject: [PATCH 074/207] tg3: Reset phy during bringup when using phylib

commit 603f11738cee4d46a2a1d394ae80d718f8d37cba upstream.

The driver puts the phy into low-power mode when it releases the device.
If the device were to be reacquired, the phy needs a reset to bring it
back to full powered operation.  This patch allows phylib-enabled
devices to reset the phy.
