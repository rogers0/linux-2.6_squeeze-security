    ARM: kirkwood: fdt: define uart[01] as disabled, enable uart0
    
    Define both uarts in kirkwood.dtsi as they are common to all kirkwood
    SoCs.  Each board may enable all or none of them, so they are disabled
    by default.  uart0 is enabled for the dreamplug.
    
    tclk can vary for each board, so we leave it undefined in the kirkwood
    dtsi.  Each board can then set it as appropriate when enabling the uart.
